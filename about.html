<p>
    Starting off, I'm 19 years old and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science w/ Data Science at VIT, Vellore. 
    After spending my entire life as an only child, dependent on my parents, in Hyderabad, living away from home in college has definitely aided in my independence. </p>
	<p>
	I'm avidly interested and adept at design, creative thinking and problem-solving. I enjoy spending and investing time in new skills and areas that pique my interest, and pride myself in learning quickly.
	Ever since my childhood, I've considered myself a balanced individual, managing both individual and social lines of my life skillfully, 
	as well as keeping personal and professional ones from intertwining. Due to this, I say my strength is based on efficient management.

    As for my hobbies, while I debate between whether to paint or to 
	write prose and poetry, I am bound to have music flowing through my mind at all times.
	Music and art compose quite a huge part of my interests aside from the technical aspects, 
	and I incorporate these into practical day-to-day activities and errands as well. 
	Either way, while logic has structure, creativity gives it direction, and hence stems
	my passion for the latter.
